          Having a licensed professional install a premium aftermarket film on your vehicle’s windows can provide several benefits; in Southern climates such as ours, window tint can reduce the interior heat transference by as much as 58% and can block 99% of harmful UV rays. While UV rays can pose a threat over time to vehicle occupants, they are extremely hard on exposed materials within your vehicle as well, so reducing this type of weathering damage can help your car retain its resale value over time.

          A legally installed premium film can potentially reduce injuries from shattered glass during an accident by keeping the debris in place.  Some people also feel safer due to the increased privacy afforded by a premium aftermarket film, and then there are people who believe a professional window tint adds a touch of class to their vehicle’s aesthetic.
